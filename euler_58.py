Spiral primes
Problem 58

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square 
spiral with side length 7 is formed.

[37] 36  35  34  33  32 [31]
 38 [17] 16  15  14 [13] 30
 39  18  [5]  4  [3] 12  29
 40  19   6   1   2  11  28
 41  20  [7]  8   9  10  27
 42  21  22  23  24  25  26
[43] 44  45  46  47  48  49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right 
diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying 
along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral 
with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the 
side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both 
diagonals first falls below 10%?
