Sum square difference
Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

sum_1 = 0
sum_2 = 0

for i in range(1, 101):
    sum_1 += i**2
    sum_2 += i

sum_2 = sum_2**2

n = sum_2 - sum_1
print(n)
